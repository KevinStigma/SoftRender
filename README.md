# SoftRender
This is a render based on Qt platform in Windows.
It implements the basic components of graphics pipeline, including transformation(camera, perspective and viewport), clipping, rasterization, backface culling, lighting, correct texturing.
It is very easy to use and observe. If you are green on computer graphics as me, you can study in this code. I hope this can help you to learn computer graphics more quickly :)
